					<p>Kisan Clinic™ is committed to supporting farmers in cultivating Kharif crops, which are grown during the monsoon season from June to September. These crops thrive in warm temperatures, high humidity, and consistent rainfall. Key examples include rice, maize, bajra (millet), jowar, ragi, tur (pigeon pea), moong (green gram), groundnut, soybean, cotton, and more.</p>
					<p>The Kharif season begins with the arrival of the monsoon in June and concludes in October, with harvesting typically occurring in October or November. These crops are categorized into six primary types: food crops, fiber crops, fodder crops, industrial crops, oilseed crops, and ornamental crops.</p>
					<p>Staple food crops like rice, maize, and millet are critical in meeting both local and global food needs. Oilseeds such as groundnut and soybean also play a vital role in agriculture and industry. At Kisan Clinic™, we provide farmers with advanced tools, expert guidance, and sustainable solutions to optimize Kharif crop cultivation and achieve higher yields.</p>
